# ShadersCourse
Material for someone somewhere somehow.

## Usage
Clone the repo (or download it) and open it with Unity.
It will contain different numbered folders in Assets, each of them represent different concepts.
Open the scene with the temary you want to know about and find all the explanations in the shaders, hit play to see their behaviour.
