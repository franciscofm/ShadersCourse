Standard surface parameter type
The SurfaceOutput struct has the following properties:
	fixed3 Albedo;: This is the diffuse color of the material
	fixed3 Normal;: This is the tangent space normal, if written
	fixed3 Emission;: This is the color of the light emitted by the material (this
	property is declared as half3 in the Standard Shaders)
	fixed Alpha;: This is the transparency of the material
	half Specular;: This is the specular power from 0 to 1
	fixed Gloss;: This is the specular intensity

The SurfaceOutputStandard struct has the following properties:
	fixed3 Albedo;: This is the base color of the material (whether it’s diffuse or
	specular)
	fixed3 Normal;
	half3 Emission;: This property is declared as half3, while it was defined as fixed3
	in SurfaceOutput
	fixed Alpha;
	half Occlusion;: This is the occlusion (default 1)
	half Smoothness;: This is the smoothness (0 = rough, 1 = smooth)
	half Metallic;: 0 = non-metal, 1= metal
The SurfaceOutputStandardSpecular struct has the following properties:
	fixed3 Albedo;.
	fixed3 Normal;.
	half3 Emission;.
	fixed Alpha;.
	half Occlusion;.
	half Smoothness;.
	fixed3 Specular;: This is the specular color. This is very different from the
	Specular property in SurfaceOutput as it allows specifying a color rather than a
single value.

Matrix:

float4x4 matrix;

float first = matrix._m00;
float last = matrix._m33;
The _mRC notation can also be chained:
float4 diagonal = matrix._m00_m11_m22_m33;

An entire row can be selected using squared brackets:

float4 firstRow = matrix[0];
// Equivalent to
float4 firstRow = matrix._m00_m01_m02_m03;
